# Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
# Output: "Sao Paulo"
# Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city.

# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
# Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
